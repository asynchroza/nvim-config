## git

`:Git blame` - if you want to check difference between different commits

`<leader>df` - if you want to check difference between current file and the last commit  

# quick notes

## Tabs - `:help tabpage`  

Instead of opening multiple instances of vim in different terminal tabs when using dadbod for querying databases, use vim tabs.  

open new tab - `:tabnew`  
go to next tab - `gt`  

## Windows = `:help window`

Move to a window - `ctrl-w <direction - hjkl>`  
Move to the next window - `alt-w`  
Increase height of window - `ctrl-w <n>+` - `ctrl-w 10+`
