### Tabs - `:help tabpage` 

Instead of opening multiple instances of vim in different terminal tabs when using dadbod for querying databases, use vim tabs. 

open new tab - `:tabnew` 
go to next tab - `gt` 

### Windows = `:help window`

Move to a window - `ctrl-w <direction - hjkl>` 
Move to the next window - `alt-w` 
Increase height of window - `ctrl-w <n>+` - `ctrl-w 10+`
